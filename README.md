# Operating System Concept

This is my Study review note repository for [Operating System Concept Book](https://www.amazon.com/Operating-System-Concepts-Abraham-Silberschatz/dp/0470128720). I am spending tons of hours ready to learn and understand Operating systems.

## Goals
My goals behind learning operating systems is to be able to:

- Develop application and system level tools.
- Freedom of developing ideas without any breach in knowledge about systems.
- Build my own mini operating system.
- Develop libraries for usage.
